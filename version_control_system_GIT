For a Lead role, these topics are essential:

✔ Basic Git Concepts:
--------------------------------------------------------------

What is Git: repository, working directory, staging area
Git is a Distributed Version Control System used to track changes in source code.
Every developer has a full copy of the repository

Repository

A Repository (repo) is a storage location where all source code and history are stored.
There are two types:
Local Repository → On your machine
Remote Repository → On GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

Working Directory:
This is the folder on your system where files are created or modified but not yet tracked.

Staging Area
When you add files (git add), they move from working directory to the staging area, meaning:
“Files are ready to be committed.”

Git local vs GitHub (remote)

✔ Core Git Commands:
--------------------------------------------------------------
git init  :Creates a new empty local repository.
git clone :Copies an existing remote repository to your machine.
git status:Shows:Modified files,Staged files,Untracked files
git add   :Moves files to staging area.
git commit:Saves the staged changes permanently in local repository.
git log   :Shows commit history.
git push  :Uploads local commits to remote GitHub repo.
git pull  :Pulls latest code from remote and merges automatically into your branch.
git fetch :Gets latest commits from remote but does NOT merge automatically.
           You can review changes first — safer than pull.

✔ Branching & Merging:
-------------------------------------------------

git branch : Lists all branches or creates a new one.
git checkout / git switch :Moves between branches:checkout → Old traditional command,
                            switch → New modern command
git merge : Combines one branch into another.
Fast-forward merge : If no changes exist in the target branch, Git simply moves the branch pointer forward.
                     No new merge commit created — clean history
Three-way merge : Happens when:Both branches have new changes,Git must combine them,
                  Creates a new merge commit.Used in real corporate projects frequently.
                    Resolving Merge Conflicts : If two developers edit the same line
                    Editing conflicting files
                    Markers (<<<<, ====, >>>>)
                    Final commit after fixing

✔ Remote Repositories (GitHub):

Add remote : git remote add origin <url>
Push to remote : git push origin main
Pull from remote : git pull
Clone from remote : git clone <url>
✔ Code Review Workflow
Pull Requests
Approvals
Comments

Merge after review:
------------------------------------------------------

✔ Git Ignore
.gitignore file
Ignoring secrets, logs, build outputs
✔ Stashing (when switching tasks)
git stash
git stash apply
git stash pop
✔ Git Reset & Revert
Undo mistakes safely
✔ Git Tags

Lightweight & annotated tags:
------------------------------------------------------------

Used for releases (v1.0, v1.1 etc.):
------------------------------------------------------------

✔ CI/CD Integration (Expected in Lead Roles):
------------------------------------------------------------
Git triggers Jenkins build

Whenever code is pushed or PR is raised, Jenkins pipeline starts automatically.

Webhooks:
A webhook in Jenkins is a mechanism that automatically triggers a Jenkins job
when something changes in your Git repository
GitHub → Jenkins communication.

PR Build Pipelines:
Before merging
Tests run
Linting runs: code level errors
Selenium/Appium suite runs
Coverage reports generated
If build fails → PR cannot be merged.
This ensures code quality before release.
Git triggers Jenkins build:

================================================================================================
installing and working with git:
check git version:
git --version

Setup your global username and email once:
git config --global user.name "ShantappaBajare"
git config --global user.email "shantappabajare@gmail.com"

Check settings:
git config --list

Create a folder for your projects:
mkdir C:\GitRepos
cd C:\GitRepos

Create your first local repository:
mkdir demo-project
cd demo-project
git init

Create a file:
echo "print('Hello World')" > app.py

Add file to staging area:
git add app.py

Commit the file:
git commit -m "Initial commit"

#Now Git is fully working locally

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step to Connect With GitHub:
-----------------------------
Create a repository on GitHub
Do not add README/ .gitignore for first time (optional but simple).

https://github.com

If you don’t have an account → click Sign up and create one.
If you already have an account → Log in.

git remote add origin https://github.com/ShantappaBajare/demo-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
