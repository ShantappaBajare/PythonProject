So each context behaves like a fresh user, without affecting other tests.
syntax:
context=browser.new_context()

new page
page=context.new_page()

Navigate
page.goto("url")

fill
page.fill("locator")

click
page.click("locator")

Assertions
expect(page).to_have_title("Dashboard")

Select options
page.select_option("locator",value)
